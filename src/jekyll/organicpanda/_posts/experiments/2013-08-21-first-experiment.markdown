Los Angeles Airways (LAA) Flight 417 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Los Angeles International Airport to the Disneyland Heliport in Anaheim, California. The aircraft and crew had completed three round trips to various destinations in the Greater Los Angeles Metropolitan Area beginning at 0607 PDT and departed the ramp at Los Angeles for Flight 417 at 1026. The flight, operating under Visual Flight Rules was cleared by Los Angeles Helicopter Control to take off and proceed eastbound at 10:28:15.

Statements were obtained from 91 witnesses. A consensus of their observations indicates that the helicopter was proceeding along a normal flightpath when a loud noise or unusual sound was heard. A main rotor blade was either observed to separate or was seen separated in the vicinity of the main rotor disc. As the helicopter fell in variously described gyrations, the tail cone either folded or separated. In order to establish an approximate altitude for the flight, several simulated flights were conducted in a similar helicopter.

The aircraft crashed in Lueders Park in Compton, a recreational park located in a residential area bordering Rosecrans Avenue. The entire fuselage, both engines, main rotor head assembly, four main rotor blades, and the pylon assembly were located in the main impact area. The fifth main rotor blade (yellow) including the sleeve and part of spindle, was located approximately .25 miles (0.40 km) north west of the main wreckage site. Minor parts associated with this rotor blade were scattered over a three-block area northwest of the park.

N300Y, a Sikorsky S-61L helicopter, serial number 61031 was the prototype for the S-61L, and had accumulated 11,863.64 total flying hours prior to the day of the accident. It is estimated that approximately 3.17 hours were flown on August 14, 1968. The aircraft was equipped with two General Electric CT58-140-1 turboshaft engines. The aircraft was serviced with 1,000 pounds (450 kg) of JP-4 fuel and had a takeoff gross weight of 17,185 pounds (7,795 kg), which was below the maximum allowable takeoff weight of 19,000 pounds (8,600 kg).
